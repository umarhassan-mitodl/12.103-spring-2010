The term project has two primary purposes: to demonstrate that you have acquired some of the scientific skills needed to understand natural hazards and provide useful information to professionals charged with developing policies and handling emergencies related to natural hazards, and to demonstrate that you are skillful in communicating scientific information. To this end, we ask you to provide a comprehensive assessment of a particular hazard at a particular location, drawn from the list below. It should include a description of the local natural processes, as well as their frequency and predictability of the hazard in question. We ask you to research and summarize the actual policies of your chosen location as they are communicated to the public, to emergency managers, to policy makers and to scientists: describe, analyze, and assess how knowledge of these risks had affected policy-making at this location. For example, critically review the measures that have been adopted to reduce the risks posed by these hazards and to minimize or alleviate their impact on people and infrastructure. Examine the policy measures that are currently in place to withstand these hazards or mitigate their risks, including the adequacy of their communication to the various relevant constituencies. You should indentify and make recommendations about any measures that are not in place but should be.
